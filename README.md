# surfs_up

## Project Overview
To support the final decision on whether to open up the surf and ice cream shop, provide temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Resources
- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio, Flask, sqlalchemy for SQLite

## Challenge Overview
Two technical analysis deliverables and a written report:
- Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
- Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December

## Results

### Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
- With 1700 readings, the average temperature in June is 75 degrees. 
- The min tempature in June is 64 degrees and the max is 85 degrees.

- Looking at the month of June on a histogram provides a better visual on the average tempature of 75 along with a nice distribution of favorable weather.

- The mode tempature for June is 76 degrees.


### Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
- With 1517 readings, the average tempature in December is 71 degrees. 
- The min tempature in December is 56 degrees and the max is 83 degrees.

- Looking at the mont of December on a histogram provides a better visual on the average tempature of 71 along with a nice distribution of favorable weather.

- The mode tempature for December is 71 degress. 

## Summary

Looking at the temp distributions for both June and December for favorable surfing weather, it's my belief the surf and ice cream shop would do well year round. 

To support the conclusion of a year round surf and ice cream store, I've also looked at the precipitation for June and December. 
### June Precipitation
- The average precipitation for June is .02 with the mode equal to 0.0.
- The min is 0.00 and the max is 4.43.

### December Precipitation
- The average precipitation for December is 0.03 and the mode is 0.0.
- The min is 0.00 and the max is 6.42
